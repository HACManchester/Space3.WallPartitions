## Overview

This is just a list of images I've put together for info

## Garage1.jpg

This is a rough idea as to what the woody area might look like with the frame / studding exposed (it is untidy)

## Wood1.jpg

This is what we've found for use with the uprights and other beams from macc reclemation

  * It's £6 a piece 120x70x3750mm, and we think they have 15 pieces
  * The idea is to cut it into 2 parts using the table saw
  * that should give us 30 x (58mm X 74mm X 3750mm) (or 2.28" x 2.91") at about £3 a piece
  * It's slightly longer than the usual 3.6m at 3.75m

## Door1.jpg

They've got a big stack of doors down there, this one is a fire door with a window at about £20
but if you want something different, ideally we need somone to go down with us / decide what's needed
