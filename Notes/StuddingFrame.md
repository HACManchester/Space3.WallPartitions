# Studding / Frame

## Overview

  * Looking at the outer partition it looks like the existing Builder has used some 3x2" with 11mm OSB on the outside and plasterboard on the inside
  * The current assumption is that the flat part of the ceiling is 3.8m high from the floor, with possibly around 2 foot above that for the curved bit

## Frames

  * For the current spec we're going to be using **4** uprights for the freestanding corners.
    The wood is an unusual length of about 3.75meters (instead of the usual 3.6)
    If we can arrange things so that the beams going horizontal across the floor sit underneath these uprights then there's a pretty good chance
    we can get away without having to have any additional blocks inbetween the ceiling and the uprights
  * It's very important we keep everything dead square when doing this, otherwise it'll have a nock on effect the further out we go
  * measure half a dozen times then cut once 
  
## Panels

  * We're probably going to need a lot of panels, so we'll probably need to get them delivered
    since trying to shift that many on a trailer would be a large pain in the ass
    This means the fun and games of someone being in the space during delivery day

  * We're making the assumption that we're only going 8ft high with the paneling for now
    (that's 2 panels up, each panel going 8ft from left to right and 4ft up) and only on one side of the frame
  * Later on you can do lots of other things such as panel all the way up, or add a cover on top
    Once we get the double glazing fitted and we see how warm it is, we can look into if other things needs to be done
  * Allowing a gap at the top should let more light in

## OSB vs Plasterboard

One idea that was initially suggested was that we have a frame with plasterboard on both sides.
However because the cost is likley to be the same, the option I've speced up so far is to have a frame with a single side of OSB
and the frame exposed on the other side.
I've tried to list all the cons and pro's of both approaches below so that everyone can think about what they want it to look like.

  * Plasterboard tends to be weaker and more prone to damage, if you want walls that look like an office then plasterboard is the way to go
    But for a workshop environment OSB is more favourable due to it being bashed about.
  * The frame for OSB involves fewer but thicker pieces, the frame for plasterboard involves thinner pieces but there's more of them
    since you need to screw in the panel at more places, so cost wise you end up with the frame costing about the same but just thinner for plasterboard.
  * If we leave one side of the wall exposed then this means we only need 1/2 as many panels, also the frame can double up as mini shelves for the woodworking areas
  * Trying to attach shelves to plasterboard will mean it won't support all that much weight, OSB by comparison means we can just screw blocks in very easily
  * If we want to use heavy doors then we won't have that option if the frame is very thin
  * If we decide to go the plasterboard route, then it's likley you'd need to cover both sides with panels instead of just one side
  * Using a thinner frame with more pieces is likley to be more painful to put together because there's a lot more bits to screw together
  * For the plasterboard route you'll need to consider additional anchoring to the ceiling, which is likley to be a pain in the ass

The one downside to the OSB route is likley just to be the way it looks, since on one side of the wall the frame will be visible

## Screws

  * It's better to use screws instead of nails when joining everything together, that way if we make a mistake it's easy to undo
    If you look at the outer partition this is what the existing Builder has already done
  * I should be able to get some free screws for attaching the panels to the frame
    But we'll need to buy some longer ones for attaching the frame together
  * As an idea, you may want to consider bolting the sections together so that they can come apart for moving around or dissasembly at a later point
  * Rawl bolts might be a bit over kill, but might be worth considering for the attachmenet to the walls
  * Counter sink the 100mm screws when putting them in
