## TODO - garlicbread

  * I'm going to re-check the measuremenets which I think are 10.5m by 13m for the space area to work out how much paint we need
    It's roughly 1L per 10square meters, so 10L is a good guess
  * Double check the heights and dimensions of the space area
  * Model in Solidworks
  * Double check the number of panels needed is 24 using solidworks

## TODO - Others

  * Bob has mentioned that the space has a trade card with selco, so it's worth someone logging on and getting the prices for comparison

  * Do we need any additional paint for the floors / walls?
  * Do we need inner door frames?

  * For the weldy / Grindy Area Heat Resistant paint is super expensive, will this need to be done later on as part of a pledge run?
