# Ceiling

## Overview

Sorting out the ceiling will probably one of the first jobs to look at.
I did hunt around for any nearyby scafolding we could "borrow" but couldn't see any

  * After a quick visit / check on the space we believe about half of what is up there at the moment needs scraping off before re-painting
  * I've already a small amount left in a 5L Tub of smooth white masonary paint I can bring in to make a start although we will need more
  * If you look just outside of the space there should be a white patch outside of the main door, this is what it will look like once dried

## Ladders

  * I have some ladders I can bring in which should reach the ceiling (they look very similar to the ones in the space, just longer)
  * However we're a little worried about the ladders disappearing, so a condition of loaning them out is that we'd like them to be padlocked to
    one of the pillars when not in use, we already have a bit of chain and padlock to use
