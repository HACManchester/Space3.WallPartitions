# Ceiling

## Overview

Sorting out the ceiling will probably one of the first jobs to look at.
I did hunt around for any nearyby scafolding we could "borrow" but couldn't see any

  * After a quick visit / check on the space we believe about half of what is up there at the moment needs scraping off before re-painting
  * I've already a small amount left in a 5L Tub of smooth white masonary paint I can bring in to make a start although we will need more
  * If you look just outside of the space there should be a white patch outside of the main door, this is what it will look like once dried

## Ladders

  * I have some ladders I can bring in which should reach the ceiling (they look very similar to the ones in the space, just longer)
  * However we're a little worried about the ladders disappearing, so if it's okay I'd like to padlock them to something
    After I bring them in / while they're not in use (maybe the lathe), I've already got a padlock and bit of chain I can use
