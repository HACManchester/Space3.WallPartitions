# Doors

## Overview

  * After discussions with Tas we've agreed that we don't need Fire Doors for fire safety, fire resistant would be good enough
  * After checking with Bob wheelchair access probably isn't that important at this stage
  * We need 4 Inner doors in total
  * I'm assuming the door for the outer partition, and the fire escape are being covered by others

## Door Options

That being said there are some other reasons why you might want to consider the fire doors we've spotted at Macclesfield Reclemation

  * They're cheap, there was at least one there at £20 maybe two
  * They have a window for seeing through
  * They're already 900mm across which covers wheelchair access (32inch)
  * One downside is they tend to be a bit heavy, but the frame we've but together should handle it without problems

Ideally we want a minimum of 850mm for wheelchair access

If you want to try and go for even cheaper doors

  * One option is to get one of the smaller ones from Wicks or B&Q, if it needs to be wider then you could always nail or screw a bit of wood onto the side of it
  * There's a whole bunch of different ones down at the reclamation place, but I'm not sure of the cost
  * It may be worth someone coming down to have a look with me to see what they want from the pile
