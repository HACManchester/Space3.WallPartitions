# Wall Suggestions

## Initial Layout

  * First we need to connect walls 3 and 4 together with an upright inbetween
  * Next measure the length of walls 3 and 4

  * Measure outwards on side wall number 1 to find out where to fasten wall 2 (use the length of walls 3 and 4)
  * Fasten wall 2 to side wall using flat wood piece to act as a wall anchor
  * Measure outwards on the brick wall the length of wall 2 to find out where wall 4 needs to be fastened

  * Join wall 3 to wall 2 using a temporary short upright <br>
    This should prevent the upright from waving about while we get additional frames up
  * Check for squareness
  * Finally join wall 4 to brick wall <br>
    don't use a flat wood piece here as its not needed and would push the wall to far out

  * When putting second frames up, remove the short upright and replace with a full length one

## Fastening

  * Fasten the frames to the wall and floor using the brackets / screws / rawl plugs
  * **DO NOT** put in the large bolts until the full frame is up, once those are in they can't be moved

  * The gap at the top of the frame to the ceiling should be 90mm <br>
    so if we can get some short pieces of 70mm x 60mm, then nail a 20mm piece to it <br>
    we can wedge / glue them at the gap at the top for additional ceiling support
