# Notes

## To look at next

The next step is to choose a couple of options

  * How much wood to use for the smaller pieces (std or Delux)
  * If to try and use the screws I've already got, or get some longer ones instead (since mine will require 24mm counter sinking)

For now I've removed the cost of paint from the spreadsheet.<br>
After we've made a few decisions we can then move onto:

  * Do the exact measurements to work out the door openings etc
  * we may need to do some test drills into the floor to see how thick it is, and see if we need any bolts for attaching to the floor
  * Get and cut the smaller pieces of the wood
  * Build the walls in bolt together sections and put one section up at a time

## Notes

### Walls

We have about 2 options for the smaller pieces of wood depending on how much we want to strengthen the frame
the cost is a bit more ether way than Version 1.

  * Option 1 (Basic) - £54
  * Option 2 (Deluxe) - £90

  * The dotted line on the drawings is where the additional wood would go for the deluxe option
  * **Red** is the large beams we already have
  * **Green** is the smaller beams we need to get
  * The wall numbers start from 2 (just because of the way we had it drawn out originaly)

See images for rough wall layout, once we've decided on the amount of wood to use we can then make some more exact measurements (door positions etc)

we can use 63 X 38 X 2400mm for the smaller bits of wood, and possibly use the planer to take it down to 60mm so that it's the same thickness one way as the other bigger wood

### Screws

We have some screws spare, but they're not long enough to go all the way through the wood.
What we can do as an option is countersink them in about 25mm

See **Screws1.jpg**

If we do the countersinking then we might be able to get away with not buying any screws <br>
since we also have some smaller black screws for attaching the OSB panels

  * We have about 600 of the black ones for attaching the OSB panels
  * about 260 80mm screws we can use for the main frame if we do the 25mm countersinking

Ideally we need to use screws in case we want to take it apart later on <br>
(also it once you use nails it'll never come apart afterwards if a mistake has been made)

### Ceiling Attachment

We've come up with a couple of different ideas for attaching the beams to the ceiling (see images).
We'll be using some sort of glue such as nonails, but also wedging / adding compression between the block of wood on the ceiling and the main upright before screwing them together

### Top Cross Beam

For the beam running horizontal along the top of the wall, we plan on having about 35mm (half of 70mm) exposed
so that the osb2 sits on half of the beam, this way we can extend it upwards later on if needed.

### Panels

We think about 20 Panels will be needed of OSB2 (covering one side)

### Door Frames

Outer door frames will be 900mm wide (just under 36")

### Corner Brackets

For some of the beams we'll need some corner brackets to attach them to the frame.
Because the metal brackets from wicks are about 1.10 each, and we need about 30 of them (for the deluxe option)
We think it's just better to use wooden triangle blocks instead (Noggins) or just drive the screw in at an angle

### Doors

There was some suggestion about putting some of the doors on sliders
not really sure what needs doing for that at the moment, just added about £20 per door for 4 doors to the list from the reclemation place
